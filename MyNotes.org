***  Section commands

These commands are for navigation and to change the visibility of
sections.

| Key                | Description                                                       |
|--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~TAB~                | toggle body of current section                                    |
| ~C-<tab>~            | cycle visibility of current section and its children              |
| ~M-<tab>~            | cycle visibility of all diff sections                             |
| ~s-<tab>~            | cycle visibility of all sections                                  |
| ~1~, ~2~, ~3~, ~4~         | show surrounding sections up to level N, hide deeper levels       |
| ~M-1~, ~M-2~, ~M-3~, ~M-4~ | globally show sections up to level N, hide deeper levels          |
| ~^~                  | goto parent section                                               |
| ~p~                  | goto beginning of section, from there to previous section         |
| ~n~                  | goto next section                                                 |
| ~M-p~                | goto beginning of section, from there to previous sibling section |
| ~M-n~                | goto next sibling section                                         |

***  Buffer commands

| Key   | Description                                                                     |
|-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~g~     | refresh current buffer and status buffer, possibly revert file-visiting buffers |
| ~G~     | refresh all Magit buffers and revert all file-visiting buffers in repository    |
| ~q~     | bury the current Magit buffer, restoring previous window configuration          |
| ~C-u q~ | kill the current Magit buffer, restoring previous window configuration          |

***  Various common commands

| Key | Description                                   |
|-----+-----------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC~ | scroll up (1)                                 |
| ~DEL~ | scroll down (1)                               |
| ~RET~ | show the thing at point in another buffer (2) |
| ~j~   | jump somewhere (3)                            |
| ~$~   | show output of recent calls to git            |

- (1) In most Magit buffers this scrolls the current buffer.
  In log buffers this instead scrolls the diff buffer shown
  in another window.
- (2) What is being shown depends on the context.
- (3) Where this jumps to depends on the context.

***  Various assorted commands

| Key   | Description                   |
|-------+-------------------------------|
| ~i~     | add a gitignore rule globally |
| ~I~     | add a gitignore rule locally  |
| ~x~     | reset using ~--mixed~           |
| ~C-u x~ | reset using ~--hard~            |

***  Prefix commands

You can use these when you're in the ~magit-status~ buffer. The list below can also be accessed by pressing ~h~, so there's no need to memorize this wiki page. Commands will open popup buffers listing infix arguments and suffix commands.

| Key   | Description          |
|-------+----------------------|
| ~A~     | cherry-pick          |
| ~b~     | branch               |
| ~B~     | bisect               |
| ~c~     | commit               |
| ~d~     | diff                 |
| ~E~     | ediff                |
| ~f~     | fetch                |
| ~F~     | pull                 |
| ~h~, ~?~  | show popup of popups |
| ~l~     | log                  |
| ~m~     | merge                |
| ~M~     | remote               |
| ~o~     | submodule            |
| ~P~     | push                 |
| ~r~     | rebase               |
| ~t~     | tag                  |
| ~T~     | note                 |
| ~V~     | revert               |
| ~w~     | apply patches        |
| ~C-u y~ | list refs (1)        |
| ~z~     | stash                |
| ~!~     | run git or gui tool  |

- (1) Actually ~y~ is bound to a popup/prefix command, but it is one of
  the few popups which default to a suffix command and therefore has to
  be called with a prefix argument to actually show the popup buffer.

***  Applying changes

| Key | Description                    |
|-----+--------------------------------|
| ~a~   | apply the change at point      |
| ~k~   | discard the change at point    |
| ~s~   | stage the change at point      |
| ~S~   | stage all unstaged changes     |
| ~u~   | unstage the change at point    |
| ~U~   | unstage all staged changes (1) |
| ~v~   | reverse the change at point    |

- (1) Actually this asks for a commit to reset the index too.  If you
  just press ~RET~, then what this equivalent to unstaging everything.
  If that is too confusing then just bind this key to ~magit-unstage-all~.

***  Diffing

These commands show diffs or manipulate the diff arguments used to
generate the diffs in the current buffer.

| Key   | Description                                   |
|-------+-----------------------------------------------|
| ~RET~ | (on commit) show commit                       |
| ~RET~ | (on stash) show stash                         |

***  Rebasing

The following commands can be used from the ~magit-rebase-popup~ which is activated using ~r~

| Key   | Description                                   |
|-------+-----------------------------------------------|
| ~i~   | Start an interactive rebase sequence.         |
| ~f~   | Combine squash and fixup commits with their intended targets. |
| ~m~   | Edit a single older commit using rebase.      |
| ~w~   | Reword a single older commit using rebase.    |
| ~k~   | Remove a single older commit using rebase.    |

Whilst performing a rebase the following editing sequences are available.

| Key   | Description                                   |
|-------+-----------------------------------------------|
| ~C-c C-c~ | Finish the current editing session by returning with exit code 0. Git then uses the rebase instructions it finds in the file. |
| ~C-c C-k~ |Cancel the current editing session by returning with exit code 1. Git then forgoes starting the rebase sequence. |
| ~RET~   | Show the commit on the current line in another buffer and select that buffer. |
| ~SPC~   | Show the commit on the current line in another buffer without selecting that buffer. If the revision buffer is already visible in another window of the current frame, then instead scroll that window up. |
| ~DEL~   | Show the commit on the current line in another buffer without selecting that buffer. If the revision buffer is already visible in another window of the current frame, then instead scroll that window down. |
| ~p~     | Move to previous line.                      |
| ~n~     | Move to next line.                          |
| ~M-p~   | Move the current commit (or command) up.    |
| ~M-n~   | Move the current commit (or command) down.  |
| ~r~     | Edit message of commit on current line.     |
| ~e~     | Stop at the commit on the current line.     |
| ~s~     | Meld commit on current line into previous commit, and edit message. |
| ~f~     | Meld commit on current line into previous commit, discarding the current commit’s message. |
| ~k~     | Kill the current action line.               |
| ~c~     | Use commit on current line.                 |
| ~x~     | Insert a shell command to be run after the proceeding commit. |
| ~y~     | Read an arbitrary commit and insert it below current line. |
| ~C-x u~ | Undo some previous changes. Like undo but works in read-only buffers. |

If a rebase is already in progress then ~magit-rebase-popup~ offers the following commands.

| Key   | Description                                   |
|-------+-----------------------------------------------|
| ~r~   | Restart the current rebasing operation.       |
| ~s~   | Skip the current commit and restart the current rebase operation. |
| ~e~   | Edit the todo list of the current rebase operation. |
| ~a~   | Abort the current rebase operation, restoring the original branch. |

* To Auto export org file to html

  Place this in the first line of the org file. Now emacs will start a background task to export the current file and you are able to work in the meantime.
  Because html export ist much faster than latex processing in my current setup I export to html and have emacs on the left half of the screen and on the other my browser.
  Every time I save my document the browser preview updates automatically
