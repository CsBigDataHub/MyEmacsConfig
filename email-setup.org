** Step 1
   1. Install mu4e and mu
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      sudo apt install mu4e
      # this will install emacs in the following path - /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e
      #+END_SRC

   2. Install other dependencies
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      $ sudo apt-get install libgmime-3.0-dev libxapian-dev
      # get emacs 25 or higher if you don't have it yet
      $ sudo apt-get install emacs

      # optional
      $ sudo apt-get install guile-2.0-dev html2text xdg-utils

      # optional: only needed for msg2pdf and mug (toy gtk+ frontend)
      $ sudo apt-get install libwebkitgtk-3.0-dev

      $ sudo apt-get install -y getmail4
      $ sudo apt install offlineimp

      $ sudo apt install isync (I am using MBSYNC)

      # isync latest version needs to be build and installed from git repo
      git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/isync/isync isync-isync
      ./autogen.sh
      ./configure
      sudo make
      sudo make install
      #+END_SRC

** Step 2

   The missing manual for setting up
   The installation of pass was quite straight forward pacman -S pass. But then the initial setup wasnâ€™t as straight forward as mentioned on the website.

   If you followed the website then, the next step after installing is running

   ~pass init "<name for pass store>"~~
   and then

   ~pass insert <nameofwebsite>/<account_name/email>~
   Which will prompt you to enter the password. But doing that resulted in following error on my arch machine.

   gpg: Password store: skipped: No public key
   gpg: [stdin]: encryption failed: No public key
   Password encryption aborted.
   So to solve this problem I had to perform the following operations:

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   Create a gpg key
   $ gpg --full-gen-key
   I use the defaults for most of the options that was prompted.

   Export the key
   $ gpg --export-secret-keys > ~/keyfile
   Import it in gpg2.
   $ gpg2 --import ~/keyfile
   this will print a keyname to prompt.

   Edit the key to set the trust level for the key
   $ gpg2 --edit-key "<Keyname>"
   use the keyname from the prompt that printed from running the previous command. You can also use $ gpg --list-keys to get the keyname. After typing the above command it will take to you gpg shell/command kind of environment. Type trust

   gpg> trust
   [...]
   Your decision? 5
   Do you really want to set this key to ultimate trust? (y/N) y
   [...]
   gpg> save
   Lastly run
   $ pass init <gpg_keyname>
   #+END_SRC
